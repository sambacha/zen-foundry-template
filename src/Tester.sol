/* 
 * üìç TECHNICAL NOTES
 * 1. The contract uses ^0.8.19 which includes important safety features like:
 *    - Overflow/underflow checks
 *    - More strict typing
 *    - Better error handling
 *
 * 2. Storage considerations:
 *    - The 'data' variable uses a dynamic string which can grow/shrink
 *    - Each storage operation costs gas based on string length
 *
 * 3. Gas optimization notes:
 *    - Uses 'calldata' for input string to save gas
 *    - Combines storage and event emission in one operation
 *    - String storage is relatively expensive, especially for longer strings
 *
 * 4. Security considerations:
 *    - Function is payable but doesn't handle received ETH
 *    - No access controls on the test function
 *    - No string length limits enforced

    /// @dev This variable is automatically given a getter function by Solidity
